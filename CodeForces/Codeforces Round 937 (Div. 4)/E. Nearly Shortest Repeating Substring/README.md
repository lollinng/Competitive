You are given a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin characters. Find the length of the shortest string k such that several (possibly one) copies of k can be concatenated together to form a string with the same length as s and, at most, one different character. More formally, find the length of the shortest string k such that c=k+⋯+kx times for some positive integer x , strings s and c has the same length and ci≠si for at most one i (i.e. there exist 0 or 1 such positions). Input The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤103 ) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105 ) — the length of string s . The second line of each test case contains the string s , consisting of lowercase Latin characters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105 . Output For each test case, print the length of the shortest string k satisfying the constraints in the statement.
