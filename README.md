BFS : 
    286  : used bfs on two consecutive square , by adding 2 nodes in queue instead of one in the start
    102  :
    1162 :
    778  : Djikstra + greedy(using minheap to store values)
    2812 : is a mix of 286 and 778 , uses maxheap instead of minheap


Djikstra's Algo (advance BFS ) - 778(modified with greedy approach)

Trie: 
    208 : Trie basic implementation
    211 : Trie modified implementation
    212 : hard problem uses backtracking and trie together to search/parse array faster
    So next time you see a problem with "a dictionary of words", you should consider tries. If you say this in an interview something like "would tries work here" the interviewer may give you hints as to whether its going to work or not.
